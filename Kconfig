config ARCH_UNIX
	bool "Unix (Linux and likely other systems)"
	select HAS_VLAN
	select HAS_MULTIPLE_VLAN
	help
	  ARCH=unix supports standard Unix system calls, although
	  the code most likely includes some Linux dependencies.
	  Choose this architecture if you build for a Linux PC
	  or embedded system

config ARCH_BARE_I386
	bool "Bare i386"
	help
	  This architecture builds a Linux-i386 executable that
	  does not rely on the standard C library, but makes
	  system calls directly.  This architecture is a test case
	  to ensure the code can run in freestanding environments
	  (microcontrollers or other contexts with no operating system)

config ARCH_BARE_X86_64
	bool "Bare x86-64"
	help
	  This architecture builds a Linux-x86-64 executable that
	  does not rely on the standard C library, but makes
	  system calls directly.  This architecture is a test case
	  to ensure the code can run in freestanding environments
	  (microcontrollers or other contexts with no operating system)

config ARCH_WRPC
	bool "White Rabbit PTP Core (WR Node)"
	select HAS_VLAN
	help
	  Build PPSi for use in the WRPC environment (SPEC card or similar
	  one).  This is a freestanding build, without operating system.
	  The configuration selects the "White Rabbit" protocol extension.

config ARCH_WRS
	bool "White Rabbit Switch"
	select HAS_VLAN
	select HAS_MULTIPLE_VLAN
	help
	  Build PPSi for use in the WR switch. The computer is a standard
	  ARM-Linux host with hardware timestamping and internal PLLs
	  needed to achieve sub-ns synchronization.
	  The configuration selects the "White Rabbit" protocol extension.

config ARCH_SIMULATOR
	bool "PPSi Simulator (hosted on Linux)"
	help
	  Build a PPSi simulator. It's almost a unix full running slave,
	  with a simulated master stimulating it for test purposes. This
	  avoids to wait a long time to see how PPSi behaves.
	  This architecture uses standard Unix system calls, but the
	  code includes some Linux dependencies.

config VLAN

	default y
	help
	  PPSI is able to directly emit and receive tagged frames,
	  with some architectures (if you see this option, it means
	  the architecture you selected has such support). A
	  designated master port can send announce on several VLANs,
	  but the other roles (designated slave or auto) can only bind
	  to a single VLAN.  This choice is a tradeoff between code
	  complexity and flexibility.
	  
	  Please note that you can always create several PTP ports that
	  act on different VLANs on the same physical port, and you can
	  also run VLAN support in your OS without special PPSI code.
	  Please see the PPSI documentation for details.

config MAX_VLANS_PER_PORT
	int "Maximum number of VLANs per port"
	depends on HAS_MULTIPLE_VLAN
	default 32
	help
	  This configuration option is mainly used to support
	  the special case of 1 VLAN per port, useful for
	  microcontroller-class architectures.  Hosted builds
	  feature a bigger default, because they have no size constraints.

	  This adds a "fault" shell command, with subcommands.
	  The same mechanisms are available in the wr switch, through
	  the configuration file.
